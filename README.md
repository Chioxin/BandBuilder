# BandBuilder

We were tasked with building a full stack web application, and our project was to create a site that would allow members of a band to find each other and create bands. This web application has an SQL database that is accessed through Java, that has REST end points that the Angular front end can hit to deliver content to the user. We were also tasked with setting up basic security that uses a salted key for each users password.

We built it from the ground up, allowing users to sign up and create bands and positions within the bands. We also allowed users to look through bands and see if there were any positions that they could fill. Users can edit their bands, or positions as the owner of a band, as well as eject users from positions.
